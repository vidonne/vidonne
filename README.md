### Hello 👋 I'm Cédric

I'm an Information Management Officer with the Global Data Service at [UNHCR](https://www.unhcr.org/) in Geneva, Switzerland.

I'm specializaed in data visualization and map making. I like to share my love for effective chart design with my colleagues and support them with [guidance, best practices and tools](https://dataviz.unhcr.org/).

I like to learn new stuff and recently started my journey with R to build beautiful and brand compliant [charts](https://vidonne.github.io/unhcrthemes/) and [reports](https://vidonne.github.io/unhcrdown/).

You can find me online at all these places:
